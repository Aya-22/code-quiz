# code-quiz

## The main focus of this project is to use JavaScript to generate a coding quiz using the activities we learned this week.

The first step taken to ahcieve my goal was to create an object with a set of arrays for each question in my quiz. I then created the functions and the addEventListner. I really struggled with this homework assignmnet. I was not able to complete the functions.

The following image shows the completed web application after using JavaScript:
